# STIX 2.1 object construction for all Flashpoint Ignite datasets.
#
# RESPONSIBILITIES:
#   - Convert Flashpoint API response dicts into lists of STIX 2.1 objects
#     ready for bundle creation and ingestion into OpenCTI
#   - Enforce all data model constraints at the conversion layer
#   - Ensure no Observable is ever orphaned (minimum floor relationship)
#   - Ensure no Relationship is ever created without a description
#   - Ensure no Indicator is created except for YARA and Sigma patterns
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS (enforced in code, not just convention):
#   1. create_relation() raises ValueError if description is empty.
#      There is no way to call it without providing a description.
#   2. INDICATOR_PERMITTED_PATTERN_TYPES controls which patterns become
#      Indicators. All other patterns produce Observables only.
#   3. Every Observable that has no resolvable entity relationship is linked
#      to the Flashpoint author identity via _floor_relation(). The floor
#      relationship is the minimum required by the data model.
#   4. Report types differ by dataset:
#        Finished intelligence → ["threat-report"]
#        Alert/communities batch Reports → ["observed-data"]
#
# DEFAULT TLP: TLP:AMBER+STRICT for all objects from all datasets.
# Dark web community content and credential data are not public; applying
# a lower marking by default would be a data governance error.
#
# DEVIATION FROM FILIGRAN:
#   - No fake intrusion-set placeholder ID in object_refs (see build_daily_report)
#   - report["body"] passed as string, not bytes (bytes breaks OpenCTI rendering)
#   - Empty relationship descriptions raise ValueError rather than silently
#     creating semantically useless edges
#   - TLP:GREEN default on communities replaced with TLP:AMBER+STRICT
#   - MediaContent observable replaced with Text observable
#   - Persona implemented (was a commented-out TODO in Filigran)
#   - alert_to_incident() replaced with bifurcated alert_to_report_objects()
#     and credential_alert_to_incident_objects()
#   - Grouping container type never created (MISP feed is dropped)

        Resolve Flashpoint report tags and actor names against the existing
        OpenCTI knowledge graph and build inter-entity relationships.

        HOW IT WORKS:
        For each tag string, queries the OpenCTI platform for an existing
        entity whose name or x_mitre_id matches the tag. If a match is found,
        a minimal STIX stub for that entity is created (with only the ID and
        name populated) and relationships between co-occurring entities are
        built based on entity type pairs.

        WHY STUBS NOT FULL ENTITIES:
        We do not create full entity definitions from tags because we have
        no reliable source for the entity's fields (motivation, resource level,
        sophistication, etc.) from a tag string alone. Populating those fields
        without source citation would violate the Assessment Note requirement.
        Instead we create stub references — enough to populate the Report's
        object_refs and build relationships — leaving the full entity definition
        to be populated by whichever connector ingested that entity originally.

        RELATIONSHIP DESCRIPTIONS:
        All relationships created here use a standard description format:
        "Resolved from Flashpoint source tag '{tag}' in: {source_context}"
        This makes the source of the relationship traceable. An analyst
        reviewing the edge knows it was machine-resolved from a tag, not
        asserted by an analyst.

        WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO:
        - Does not create new entities not already in the graph
        - Does not populate vocabulary fields (motivation, role, etc.)
        - Does not create Assessment Notes (tags don't carry that level of detail)

        Convert a Flashpoint finished intelligence report dict into a list

        CONTAINER: stix2.Report with report_types=["threat-report"]
        CONTAINMENT: All knowledge graph objects resolved from tags and actors
                     are members of the Report via object_refs.

        OBJECT_REFS HANDLING:
        The STIX spec requires at least one entry in object_refs. When
        _guess_knowledge_graph() resolves nothing (the report tags don't
        match any existing graph entities), object_refs would be empty.
        Rather than injecting a fake placeholder ID (the Filigran approach),
        we fall back to the author identity ID. The author identity always
        exists, and referencing it is semantically accurate — the Report
        is authored by Flashpoint. This avoids the phantom reference problem.

        BODY CONTENT:
        report["body"] is passed as a string to x_opencti_content.
        The Filigran connector encoded it as bytes (.encode("utf-8")), which
        breaks content rendering in the OpenCTI UI. The custom property
        expects a string.

        PUBLISHED DATE:
        Uses report["posted_at"] (the Flashpoint publication date), NOT the
        current date. Using the ingestion date as the published date corrupts
        all temporal queries and timeline analysis. If posted_at cannot be
        parsed, falls back to the current UTC time with a warning.

        Convert an org-domain credential alert into STIX objects for
        an Incident Response container.

        This method is called when an alert matches a configured org domain,
        indicating the alert is directly relevant to the organisation and
        warrants IR treatment rather than the generic batch Report path.

        CONTAINER: The IR container (case_incident) is created by the
        connector dispatcher — this method returns only the member objects.

        OBJECTS CREATED:
          - stix2.Incident SDO — the primary container member representing
            the credential exposure event
          - Text Observable — the alert highlight text
          - URL Observable — the Flashpoint platform URL
          - Relationships linking each Observable to the Incident

        ALERT.MD ATTACHMENT:
        A Markdown summary of the alert metadata is generated and attached
        to the Incident via x_opencti_files. This gives analysts a
        human-readable summary of the alert directly in the OpenCTI UI
        without needing to navigate to Flashpoint Ignite.

        MEDIA ATTACHMENT:
        For media-source alerts (images, files), the binary content is
        attached alongside the Markdown summary if present in the alert dict.

        """
        Convert a single Flashpoint Communities search result into STIX
        objects for accumulation into a daily batch Report container.

        OBJECT MODEL:
          Channel → the forum or platform where the post appeared
          Persona → the actor handle who posted (if available)
          Text    → the raw post content

        RELATIONSHIP MODEL (per data model §3.4j):
          Text → related-to → Persona  (Observable → Related To → Identity)
          Persona → related-to → Channel
          Channel → publishes → Text   (preferred; falls back to related-to
                                        if platform rejects at runtime)

        PERSONA NOTE:
        Persona objects are created where a handle is present in the source
        data. No Individual SDO is linked to the Persona because Flashpoint
        community data provides only the handle — we have no confirmed
        real-world identity behind it. The data model requires a confirmed
        identity to justify the Persona → Related-To → Individual edge.
        Creating that edge from a handle alone would be an unsourced
        attribution assertion.

        CHANNEL NOTE:
        Channel names are stripped of Flashpoint's <x-fp-highlight> markup
        before use. The markup is injected to highlight search matches and
        must not appear in entity names.

        FLOOR RELATIONSHIPS:
        If a Persona cannot be created (no handle), the Text Observable
        receives a floor relationship to the Flashpoint author identity.
        If a Channel cannot be created (no name), the Persona receives
        a floor relationship to the Flashpoint author identity.

            * Field name for the discovery/first-seen timestamp
            * Field name for the source URL (if present)

        Expected object model once implemented:
          - stix2.Incident SDO (for org-domain records going to IR)
          - User-Account Observable (credential username/email)

        is called. This means:
          - If the connector runs twice in the same day, the second run
