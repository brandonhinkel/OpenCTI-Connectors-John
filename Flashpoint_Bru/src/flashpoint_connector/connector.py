# =============================================================================
# Main connector orchestration: scheduling, state management, dataset
# dispatchers, and Incident Response container management.
#
# RESPONSIBILITIES:
#   - Schedule the connector run via helper.schedule_iso()
#   - Maintain per-dataset state cursors (reports, alerts, communities,
#     credentials — each independently tracked)
#   - Dispatch each enabled dataset to its import method
#   - Bifurcate alerts and credentials between Report and IR containers
#   - Create and manage Incident Response containers for org-domain hits
#   - Build daily batch Report containers from accumulated objects
#   - Log per-dataset statistics for operational monitoring
#
# STATE MANAGEMENT — KEY DESIGN DECISION:
# Each dataset tracks its own cursor independently in the connector state
# store. A failure in one dataset does not advance any other dataset's cursor.
#
# WHY: The Filigran connector used a single shared `last_run` key. If reports
# ingested successfully but alerts failed, the next run would skip all alerts
# from the failed window because last_run had already advanced. This caused
# silent data loss. Per-dataset cursors make failure recovery deterministic:
# a failed dataset re-fetches from its last successful position on the next run.
#
# STATE SCHEMA:
#   {
#     "reports_last_run":     "ISO8601",   # Updated after successful reports run
#     "alerts_last_run":      "ISO8601",   # Updated after successful alerts run
#     "communities_last_run": "ISO8601",   # Updated after successful communities run
#     "credentials_last_run": "ISO8601",   # Updated after successful credentials run
#   }
#
# ALERT BIFURCATION:
# Alerts split into two paths based on org domain matching:
#   Org-domain match → Incident Response container (one IR per alert)
#   No match         → Daily batch Report (accumulated by date, sent at end)
#
# DAILY BATCH REPORTS:
# Alerts and Communities results are accumulated in per-day buckets during
# the run. After all records for a dataset are processed, the buckets are
# flushed as Report containers via build_daily_report(). The Report ID is
# deterministic (name + date), so re-running on the same day upserts the
# existing container rather than creating a duplicate.
#
# IR CONTAINERS:
# Follow the UDM connector pattern exactly:
#   1. Lookup by name before create (prevents duplicates)
#   2. externalReferences passed as list of resolved IDs (inline dicts
#      are rejected by the OpenCTI GraphQL schema — BAD_USER_INPUT)
#   3. Objects added individually via add_stix_object_or_stix_relationship()
#
# CONNECTOR SUPERSEDES FILIGRAN:
# The Filigran upstream connector (external-import/flashpoint) must be
# stopped and removed from docker-compose.override.yml before deploying
# this connector. Running both simultaneously will produce duplicate
# Reports, duplicate Observables, and conflicting relationships.

        Each alert is evaluated against the org domain list:
          - Org-domain match → Incident Response container
          - No match → daily batch Report accumulator

        IR PATH (org-domain):
          1. Create or retrieve IR container by deterministic name
          2. Convert alert to Incident + Observable objects
          3. Send each object as a bundle (ensures platform processes before add)
          4. Add each object to IR container individually

        BATCH REPORT PATH (keyword match):
          1. Process alert into STIX member objects
          2. Accumulate in keyword_buckets[date_str]
          3. After all alerts processed: flush each date bucket as a Report

        FLUSH:
        Daily batch Reports are only constructed after all alerts have been
        processed and bucketed. This ensures each Report contains the complete
        set of objects for that day rather than being sent incrementally
        (which would create multiple Reports for the same day).

        The Report ID is deterministic (name + date), so if the connector
        is re-run on the same day, the existing Report is upserted.

        ALERT.md ATTACHMENT NOTE:
        For IR-path alerts, the alert.md markdown file is generated by the
        converter and attached to the Incident via x_opencti_files. This
        file provides analysts with a formatted summary of the alert without
        requiring them to navigate to Flashpoint Ignite.

        Search Flashpoint dark web community posts and ingest results.

        ONE QUERY PER DAILY BATCH REPORT:
        Each configured query term produces its own independent set of
        daily batch Reports. Results from different queries are not mixed —
        "cybersecurity" hits and "ransomware" hits go into separate Reports.
        This allows analysts to filter by query topic and maintains clear
        provenance (which query produced which content).

        QUERY SANITISATION:
        Query terms are sanitised for use in Report names by replacing
        forward and back slashes. This prevents unintended path separators
        in the deterministic Report name.

        CHANNEL → PUBLISHES → TEXT NOTE:
        The 'publishes' relationship type between Channel and Text is
        emitted by the converter. If the OpenCTI platform's worker does
        not support this relationship type for these entity types, it will
        reject only that edge — the rest of the bundle (Channel, Persona,
        Text, and other relationships) will still land. The rejection will
        appear in worker logs, not here. Check worker logs after the first
        communities run to confirm whether 'publishes' is accepted.

        PERSONA NOTE:
        CustomObservablePersona is imported inside the converter. If this
        custom observable type is not available in pycti==7.260309.0, Persona
        creation will fail with a warning per-result, and the Text observable
        will receive a floor relationship to the Flashpoint identity instead.

        Import Flashpoint compromised credential records.

        !! NOT IMPLEMENTED — STUB ONLY !!

        This method exists as a stub so that:
          1. import_credentials=True in config does not crash the connector
          2. The intended behaviour is documented in code
          3. The missing implementation is clearly visible in logs

        The stub logs a warning and returns without advancing the cursor
        or making any API calls. The credentials_last_run cursor is never
        set, so when the implementation is complete, the connector will
        automatically backfill from import_start_date on its first real run.

        WHAT THIS METHOD WILL DO ONCE IMPLEMENTED:
          1. Read credentials_last_run cursor
          2. Fetch credential records from Flashpoint API since cursor
          3. For each record:
               - Check if email/domain matches org_domains
               - Org match → create IR container + Incident + Observables
               - No match → accumulate in daily batch Report
          4. Flush non-org daily batch Reports
          5. Advance credentials_last_run cursor

        WHAT IS BLOCKING IMPLEMENTATION:
          The Flashpoint Compromised Credentials API endpoint path, date
          filter parameter name, pagination style, and response field
          schema are not yet confirmed from docs.flashpoint.io.

        Main connector execution method — called by the scheduler on each run.

        EXECUTION ORDER:

          3. Communities — dark web forum search results
          4. Credentials — compromised credentials (stub)

        ISOLATION:
        Each dataset dispatcher is called inside its own try/except block.
        A failure in one dataset (API error, conversion error, send error)
        is logged and the next dataset proceeds. This ensures a transient
        API error for one endpoint does not prevent ingestion of other
        datasets in the same run.

        CURSOR ADVANCEMENT:
        Each dispatcher advances its own cursor only on successful completion.
        If a dispatcher raises an unhandled exception before reaching its
        _set_cursor() call, the cursor is not advanced and the next run
        will re-fetch from the same start position for that dataset.

        KEYBOARD INTERRUPT:
        Caught explicitly to allow graceful shutdown. The connector logs

        Start the connector's scheduling loop.

        schedule_iso() calls process_data() on the configured interval
        (CONNECTOR_DURATION_PERIOD, ISO-8601 format, e.g. PT6H).
        The scheduler also monitors the connector's work queue depth — if
        the queue exceeds CONNECTOR_QUEUE_THRESHOLD (default 500MB), the
        scheduler skips the next run until the queue drains. This prevents
        the connector from overwhelming the OpenCTI worker under high load.

        This method blocks indefinitely — the connector runs until the
        container is stopped.
