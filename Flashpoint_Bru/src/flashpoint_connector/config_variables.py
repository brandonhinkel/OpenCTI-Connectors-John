# Connector configuration loader.
#
# All configuration is read from two sources in priority order:
#   1. Environment variables (higher priority — used in Docker deployments)
#   2. config.yml (lower priority — used for local development)
#
# get_config_variable() from pycti handles the precedence logic. Every
# variable that has a default is safe to omit from the environment; every
# variable without a default will raise at startup if absent.
#
# DESIGN NOTE — why per-dataset confidence defaults are here:
# Confidence values are not static — they reflect the epistemological
# reliability of each Flashpoint data source. Finished intelligence reports
# are analyst-written Tier-1 intelligence (75). Raw alert rule hits are
# unvalidated signals (50). Org-domain credential matches carry higher
# signal because the domain match is a deterministic linkage (70). Dark
# web community posts are unvalidated raw content (30). These defaults are
# overridable via environment variables to allow tuning without code changes.
#
# DEVIATION FROM FILIGRAN — the Filigran connector had a bug where
# import_communities was assigned twice: first correctly from
# FLASHPOINT_IMPORT_COMMUNITIES, then immediately overwritten by
# FLASHPOINT_ALERTS_CREATE_RELATED_ENTITIES. This meant communities import
# could never be enabled independently of alert entity creation. That bug
# is fixed here — each variable maps to exactly one config key.
